# **Why AI?**

Let's have and example of `Coffee on Wheels`, an international company that sells coffee on trucks in cities like: London, New York, San Francisco, and Tokyo, provides a compelling case study.

`Coffee on Wheels` is facing three challenges that are: 
* **`Location Selection and route optimization`:** Predicting popular locations for truck placement and Optimizing routes based on weather and traffic conditions.
* **`Sales Forecast and Real-Time Monitoring` :** Forecasting sales and monitoring performance in real-time.
* **`Marketing campaign Automation` :** Automating marketing campaigns to increase efficiency and effectiveness.

To solve this we need the real-time location, data of sales and public interactions. We have to make an dashboard with it should be connected through the real-time DB by which we can fetch and show to our dashboard and the Admin can give the desired data to the `Coffee on Wheels`.
